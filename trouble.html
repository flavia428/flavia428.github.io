strong
family bonds led by a matriarch. They use their trunks for eating, drinking, and
communication.

<p>
There are three main species of elephants — each adapted to its own habitat:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>African Savannah Elephant:</strong> Found in open grasslands.</li>
<li><strong>African Forest Elephant:</strong> Smaller, lives in dense forests.</li>
<li><strong>Asian Elephant:</strong> Found across South and Southeast Asia.</li> <!-- there's an extra closing </li> tag in the list, this can cause layouts to break out, and by fixing it, it keeps the <ul> list valid-->
<div class="info-box">
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Elephant ears help regulate body temperature!</p> <!-- there's an unclose </strong> tag in the info box, i fixed this error so the element can load properly-->

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>

<div class="fact-card">🐘 Elephants can recognize themselves in mirrors.</div> <!-- this fact card is not properly closed, i added a closing </div> tag so the browser wont get confuse and cause layout breakouts-->
<div class="fact-card">💧 They use their trunks like snorkels when swimming.</div>
<div class="fact-card">🌿 They eat up to 300 pounds of food per day!</div></div>
</div> <!-- i deleted a closing </div> tag since each fact card already has it's own closing </div tag>, and we only need one closing </div> tag to close the facts container.-->

<div id="footer"> <!-- there's a missing > in the footer div, the footer didn't render and the p tag can be ignored or misplaced, by closing the tag, it stops he footer from breaking my entire page and the html can work properly-->
